 # Project Overview

Bank of Flatiron is a React-based web application that allows users to manage their bank transactions. Users can view a table of all transactions, add new transactions, filter transactions by description, and delete transactions from the table.
 
 # Core and Bonus Features
 As a user, you can:

    .See a table of all transactions.
    .Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. The new transaction will be added to the table (the data does not have to be persisted to the backend).
    .Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term will be shown in the transactions table.
    . Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.
    . Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table.
